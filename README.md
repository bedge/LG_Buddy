# LG Buddy

Inspired by [LGTV Companion for Windows](https://github.com/JPersson77/LGTVCompanion), LG Buddy makes an LG WebOS TV behave more like a monitor for a Linux PC.

It can:

- turn the TV on at boot and wake
- turn the TV off at shutdown and before system sleep
- blank and restore the panel on desktop idle and activity
- adjust OLED pixel brightness with a small desktop dialog

LG Buddy supports GNOME and `swayidle`-based sessions. Official release bundles include a prebuilt `lg-buddy` binary, so normal installation does not require a Rust toolchain.

If you build `lg-buddy` from source instead of using a release bundle, `cargo`
now also needs a working C toolchain because the vendored `libdbus` runtime is
compiled as part of the build.

## Before You Install

Install prerequisites:

- `python3-venv`
- `python3-pip`
- `zenity`

Backend-specific:

- `swayidle` for the `swayidle` backend

The GNOME backend requires a compatible GNOME session with:

- GNOME Shell
- `org.gnome.ScreenSaver`
- `org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor`

At runtime, GNOME support now uses a persistent in-process session-bus client
for shell detection, ScreenSaver signals, and Mutter idletime polling.

Typical package installs:

**Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!_OS**
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip zenity
```

**Fedora**
```bash
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-virtualenv zenity
```

**Arch**
```bash
sudo pacman -S python python-pip python-virtualenv zenity
```

For source builds, also install a C toolchain:

- Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!_OS: `build-essential`
- Fedora: `gcc`
- Arch: `base-devel`

## Install

1. Download the release archive for your platform.
2. Extract it.
3. Run:

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will prompt for your TV IP, MAC address, HDMI input, idle-monitor backend, idle timeout, and screen restore policy, then install the required services.

On first use, you may need to accept a pairing prompt on the TV:

## Day to Day

LG Buddy is mostly automatic after installation.

- To change settings later, run `./configure.sh`
- To check the screen monitor, run `systemctl --user status LG_Buddy_screen.service`
- To remove LG Buddy, run `./uninstall.sh`

Advanced session restore behavior can be tuned in `config.env`:

```ini
screen_idle_timeout=300
screen_restore_policy=conservative
```

`screen_restore_policy=conservative` is the default. LG Buddy only restores when a matching LG Buddy marker says it previously blanked or powered off the TV.

Set `screen_restore_policy=aggressive` to let session wake/activity and system wake restore the TV even when no LG Buddy marker exists. This is intentionally more aggressive and can turn the TV on in cases where another device or a manual action powered it off.

`marker_only` is still accepted as a legacy alias for `conservative`.
